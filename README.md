# OslofjordRV

## Setup

The only setup you need to do is for ngrok.

1. Clone this repo.

2. Go to the [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) website and create a free account.

3. Navigate to your ngrok dashboard, and create a free static domain.

4. Insert your authtoken and static domain into the `ngrok.yml` file in this repo.

Once you've done all the above steps, you're free to run the `compose.yaml` file in the OslofjordDB repo. That file includes setup for OslofjordRV.

## Usage

After the setup, the OslofjordRV component is triggered by the front end and will run in the back end.
